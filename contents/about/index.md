I was born in the small town of Bobcaygeon, Ontario (home of the amazing [Kawartha Dairy](http://kawarthadairy.com/)!)
After graduating from high school, I was persuaded by the founding President to join the first class of computer science students at the [University of Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT)](https://uoit.ca/).
While there, I spent some time building [solar cars](https://news.uoit.ca/archives/2006/12/20061215_1.php) among other things..

I then made my way to the [Department of Computer Science](http://web.cs.toronto.edu/) at the University of Toronto to complete my Masters with Professor [Eyal de Lara](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~delara/).
My research revolved around scaling databases using the [SnowFlock project](http://sysweb.cs.toronto.edu/projects/1).
I graduated in February 2011 and spent some time working in the startup scene in Toronto and Montreal.
I then completed my PhD in the [Data Systems Group](https://uwaterloo.ca/data-systems-group/) computer science at the University of Waterloo under the supervision of Professor [Ken Salem](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~kmsalem/).
As of August 2018, I have joined the faculty at the [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.cs.rit.edu/) as an Assistant Professor.
This site contains some information on [projects I have worked on](/projects/).
