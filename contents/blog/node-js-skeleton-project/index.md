Unfortunately, it's obviously been a long time since this blog has been updated.
Since the last post, I've been hard at work rewriting our Web app in Django (finally got rid of our old PHP) and picking up iPhone app development.
Keep an eye out for some cool stuff coming up in the near future.

In my spare time, I've been playing around with Node.js development.
I decided to release the sample project Iâ€™ve been working on.
You may find it useful if you're looking to get up and running quickly.
It's still a work in progress, but it's coming along nicely.
