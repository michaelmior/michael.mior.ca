summary: "Updates to the RUBBoS bulletin board application for Web application benchmarking fixes bugs in the PHP implementation."

While working on my Masters thesis, I needed a solid database benchmark.
RUBBoS is a fairly common benchmark in the field, but unfortunately is a few years out of date.
While it was fantastically simple to set up, I did run into a few issues associated with newer versions of PHP and Java as well as a few minor bugs.

Since the benchmark is fully open-source, I decided to release my modifications.
You can download these changes to RUBBoS via [GitHub](https://github.com/michaelmior/RUBBoS).
Installation instructions and some additional notes can also be found there.
The most important thing to note is that I have only tested the LAMP version of the application.

Hope someone finds this useful!
