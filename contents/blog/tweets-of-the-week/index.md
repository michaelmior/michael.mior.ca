In an effort to keep the blog postings more regular, I thought I would start sharing a selection of the most popular links from my Twitter feed in-between more detailed posts.

* [Movember Man Hypothesis – Adam Doran](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqbiHyuGKIo)

  This one goes at the top because it’s for good friend and a good cause.
  Check out this video we produced to help put our weight behind [Prostate Cancer Canada‘s Movember](http://www.prostatecancer.ca/) campaign.
  Share the video and help raise awareness about prostate cancer!

* [Yoshinori Matsunobu’s blog: Using MySQL as a NoSQL – A story for exceeding 750,000 qps on a commodity server](http://yoshinorimatsunobu.blogspot.com/2010/10/using-mysql-as-nosql-story-for.html)

  It's great to see not everyone is giving up on traditional RDMS systems.
  Granted this isn't a typical use (like [Flickr’s abuse of MySQL](http://code.flickr.com/blog/2010/02/08/ticket-servers-distributed-unique-primary-keys-on-the-cheap/)).
  However, a lot of engineering effort has gone into these systems, and it's a shame to see that go to waste.
  Especially, when most sites never need to scale to millions of users (as much as they may wish for it).

* [AWS Free Usage Tier](http://aws.amazon.com/free/)
  I hope this serves as motivation for those who haven't started using the cloud to at least try it out.
  In the early stages of a startup, there’s no need to deal with managing your own hardware.
  Great way to scale your costs with size of your business.

* [How to Measure Page Load Time With Google Analytics - Web Performance Blog](http://blog.yottaa.com/2010/10/how-to-measure-page-load-time-with-google-analytics/)

  Coming from the boonies, with Internet connections of unreliable speed, I appreciate sites which load fast.
  Of course, bandwidth may not be the only reason your site loads slow for users.
  As noted in the comments on the post, you should also check out Yahoo! Boomerang which gives an easy way to ping your server with some client-side load statistics

* [How to Fund a Startup](http://www.paulgraham.com/startupfunding.html)

  [Paul Graham](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(computer_programmer)) is a well known fellow within the startup community.
  This post has some lovely advice for those startups a little light on cash.
