You've reached the personal website of <a class="h-card" rel="me" href="https://michael.mior.ca/">Michael Mior</a>.
I recently completed my PhD in the [David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/) at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/). Starting mid-August, I'm an Assistant Professor at the [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.cs.rit.edu/).

The rest of the site has more [about me](/about/).
To get in touch, send me an <a rel="me" class="u-email" href="mailto:michael@mior.ca">email</a> and we'll talk. (Students should contact me using my [RIT email](mailto:mmior@cs.rit.edu).
