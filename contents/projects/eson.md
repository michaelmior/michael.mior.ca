*An implementation of our ESON normalization algorithm is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/michaelmior/eson)*

Constructing a normalized model from a NoSQL database is a challenging problem.
Traditional normalization algorithms such as lossless join BCNF decomposition fail to appropriately handle the forms of denormalization present in NoSQL databases.
Appropriate algorithms for constructing a normalized schema from NoSQL databases are a critical step in performing meaningful data integration with other sources.
