Below is a list of some of my favorite tools that I use in my work.

## Hardware

While my daily driver is a MacBook, I tend to do most of my development via remote machines running Linux.

- MacBook Pro
- Google Pixel
- reMarkable tablet (mostly for reading/annotating papers)

## Editor

- Neovim ([heavily customized](https://github.com/michaelmior/vimrc))
- EditorConfig

## Utilities

I generally prefer tools written in Rust where I can find them.
They're easy to install since I always have a Rust environment set up and they're generally fast.

- git
- [mosh](https://mosh.org/) instead of SSH since i tolerates loss of connection
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) to keep track of sets of processes for different projects
- [pv](https://linux.die.net/man/1/pv) - super useful for quick progress monitoring
- [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) as a replacement for `find`
- [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) as a replacement for `cat`
- [rg](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) as a replacement for `grep`
- [xsv](https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv) for CSV processing
- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) and [gron](https://github.com/tomnomnom/gron) for JSON processing
- [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) for managing any Python utilities
- [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) for Python package management
- [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to manage Python versions
- [jabba](https://github.com/shyiko/jabba) to manage Java versions
- [n](https://github.com/tj/n) to manage Node versions

## Languages

- zsh for quick scripts
- Python for AI/ML and more complicated scripting
- Scala for anything that needs to run on the JVM or via Apache Spark
- Rust for things that really need to be fast
- JavaScript for anything that runs in the browser

## Research

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for note-taking
- [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) for writing
- [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) for reference management
