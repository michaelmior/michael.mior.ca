title: About
---
I was born in the small town of Bobcaygeon, Ontario (home of the amazing Kawartha Dairy!)
After graduating from high school, I was persuaded by the founding President to join the first class of computer science students at the University of Ontario Institute of Techology (UOIT).
While there, I spent some time building solar cars, showing students around, and lending a hand on campus.

I then made my way to the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto to complete my Masters with Professor Eyal de Lara.
My research revolved around scaling databases using the SnowFlock project.
I graduated in January 2011 and spent some time working in the startup scene in Toronto and Montreal.
I am now studying towards my PhD in computer science at the University of Waterloo under the supervision of Professor Ken Salem.

In my spare time, I like to read up on the latest in Web design and development, do a little cooking, and explore the fabulous cities of Toronto and Montreal.
