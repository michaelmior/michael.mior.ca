  This is my new blog which Iâ€™ve been meaning to put up for some time now.
  I've been looking for a way to share some of the various scripts I've written and tips I've come up with.
  Hopefully someone out there in the blogosphere will find these useful.
  I plan to post on a fairly wide range of topics, but all centred around programming and the web.
  If you're not ready to subscribe just yet, you can also

  If you have any suggestions or topics you'd like to see for a post, feel free to
  = link_to('contact me', '/contact/') + '.'
