This is my new blog which Iâ€™ve been meaning to put up for some time now.
I've been looking for a way to share some of the various scripts I've written and tips I've come up with.
Hopefully someone out there in the blogosphere will find these useful.
I plan to post on a fairly wide range of topics, but all centred around programming and the web.
